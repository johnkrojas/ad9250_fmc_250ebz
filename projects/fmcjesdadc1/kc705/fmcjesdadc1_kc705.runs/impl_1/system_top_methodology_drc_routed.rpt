TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks rx_div_clk and spi_sdio_out_OBUF are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks rx_div_clk] -to [get_clocks spi_sdio_out_OBUF]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks rx_div_clk and spi_sdio_out_OBUF are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks rx_div_clk] -to [get_clocks spi_sdio_out_OBUF]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-25#1 Critical Warning
Invalid clock waveform on gigabit transceiver (GT)  
The waveform of the user clock rx_div_clk defined on the transceiver output pin i_system_wrapper/system_i/util_fmcjesdadc1_xcvr/inst/i_xch_0/i_gtxe2_channel/RXOUTCLK or on the net connected to that pin is not consistent with the transceiver settings. The auto-derived clock period is 4.000 and the user-defined clock period is 8.000. The expected clock waveform is computed based on the GT settings and the incoming clock to the transceiver. It is recommended to check that there are no missing clocks to the GT and that all the transceiver settings are correct

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '22' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
